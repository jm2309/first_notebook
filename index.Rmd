## Survey sheds light on the 'crisis' rocking research. {#markdown-header}
**More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments,** and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments. Those are some of the telling figures that emerged from *Nature's* survey of 1,576 researchers who took a brief online questionnaire on reproducibility in research. 
\

The data reveal sometimes-contradictory attitudes towards reproducibility. Although 52% of those surveyed agree that there is a significant 'crisis' of reproducibility, less than 31% think that failure to reproduce published results means that the result is probably wrong, and most say that they still trust the published literature.

## The Survey
In the survey [^1] respondents were asked to rate 11 different approaches to improving reproducibility in science. Below is the list order by the most highly rated: 

* Better understanding of statistics
* Better mentoring/supervision 
* More robust design 
* Better teaching 
* More within-lab validation 
* Incentives for better practice 
* Incentives for formal reproduction 
* More external-lab validation 
* More time for mentoring 
* Journals enforcing standards 
* More time checking notebooks
